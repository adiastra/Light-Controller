# Light-Controller
Cycles on and off 4 separate relays based on information from a real time clock.

  The real time clock in this case is a DS3231 (library included)
  
  The relays are controling 2 LED light bars each with 3 modes (day/night/off).
  
  You have to set the time for the RTC using the commented out code in the setup section
  
  For this configuration relays 1 and 3 switch between two different modes on the light bar
  
  relays 3 and 4 turn off the bars and should be wired in series.
